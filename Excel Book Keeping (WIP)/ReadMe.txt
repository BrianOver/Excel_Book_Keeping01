This is a project for book keeping/data entry that is made for personal finance managment
I use this for my own personal tracking, but this particular book uses random numbers

"Sample_Book01.xlsm" is the excel book that the data is being entered into
"Data_Creation (WIP)" is the WIP java project that creates the random data
	
Work in progress items:
-Making the import process into excel automatic and daily, including adjusting the excel code to adjust to the current month and corresponding month
-Making the data more normal, and improving the logic to make it more realistic
